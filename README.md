# Foundry VTT Module: More Activities for dnd5e

This module adds more activities to items with certain tags, allowing an integration between modules like the amazing
[Ready Set Roll for dnd5e](https://github.com/MangoFVTT/fvtt-ready-set-roll-5e) and the system's special item actions,
such as off-hand attacks for light weapons, two-handing versatile weapons, or throwing thrown weapons.
